      "To address these inefficiencies, our project proposes the introduction of an innovative, AI-driven solution designed to automate the generation of bar bending schedules. This technology aims to streamline the construction planning phase, ensuring precise calculation of BBS fields according to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the National Building Code of India (NBC). By doing so, we anticipate a significant reduction in time, cost, and material wastage, ultimately elevating the construction process in India.",
